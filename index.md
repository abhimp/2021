AIMLSystems is a brand new conference targeting research in the intersection of AI/ML
techniques and systems engineering. Through this conference we plan to bring out and highlight
the natural connections with these two fields. Specifically we explore how immense strides in
AI/ML techniques are made possible through computational systems research (e.g.,
improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, communications etc.), 
how the use of AI/ML can help in the continuous and workload-driven design space exploration
of computational systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimizers, learnable
network systems etc.) and, the use of AI/ML in the design of socio-economic systems such as
public healthcare, and security.



{:.text-justify.pe-4}
Authors are encouraged to submit previously unpublished research at the intersection of
computational / socio-economic systems and AI/ML. The papers will be selected by the TPC
based on their quality, novelty, utility and potential impact.
