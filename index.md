AIMLSystems is a brand new conference targeting research in the intersection of AI/ML
techniques and systems engineering. Through this conference we plan to bring out and highlight
the natural connections with these two fields. Specifically we explore how immense strides in
AI/ML techniques are made possible through computational systems research (e.g.,
improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, communications etc.), 
how the use of AI/ML can help in the continuous and workload-driven design space exploration
of computational systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimizers, learnable
network systems etc.) and, the use of AI/ML in the design of socio-economic systems such as
public healthcare, and security.

##### Why Another AI/ML Conference? 

Through this annual conference, we are aiming to cover the whitespace at the intersection of data-intensive AI/ML techniques and systems engineering. We also aspire to become the leading forum for sharing practical experiences from building and deploying AI/ML systems in the socio-economic spheres such as public healthcare and security. 

Although being held in India, the conference aims to attract international participation and emphasize gender and geographic diversity.

This conference series is an initiative of the [COMSNETS Association](http://www.comsnets-association.org/), a not-for-profit organization, which has organized the prestigious [COMSNETS](https://comsnets.org) networking conference each year since 2009. 

The AIMLSystems conference is in the process of obtaining technical co-sponsorship from IEEE and In-cooperation status from
ACM. The conference plans to partner with several academic institutions and research labs.

##### Location of the Conference

The AIMLSystems'21 conference will be held in Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of Asia. 

Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern Karnataka state. The center of India's high-tech industry, the city is also known for its parks and nightlife. Bangalore boasts of some of the finest institutions in the world such as the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), the [Raman
Research Institute](http://www.rri.res.in/), the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics](https://www.iiap.res.in/), the [Indian Institute of Management](https://www.iimb.ac.in/), to name a few. 

Almost every multinational corporation including Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc has a research lab in Bangalore. Apart from MNCs, Bangalore is also home to many startups and Indian tech companies. such as Infosys and Wipro.

Besides being a global technology hub, Bangalore is rightfully called the garden city and is also close to many national parks and interesting tourist sites.

##### Timing of the Conference

The conference is sandwiched between the two major Indian festivals, [Dussehera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayadashami) and [Diwali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali). In particular, the Mysore Dussehra in the nearby city of Mysore is arguably one of the most prominent cultural events of India.
