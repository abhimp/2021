AIMLSystems is a brand new conference targeting research in the intersection of AI/ML techniques and systems engineering. Through this conference we plan to bring out and highlight the natural connections with these two fields. Specifically we explore how immense strides in AI/ML techniques are made possible through computational systems research (e.g., improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, communications etc.),  how the use of AI/ML can help in the continuous and workload-driven design space exploration of computational systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimizers, learnable network systems etc.) and, the use of AI/ML in the design of socio-economic systems such as public healthcare, and security.  The goal is to bring together these diverse communities and elicit connections between them.

Authors are encouraged to submit previously unpublished research at the intersection of computational / socio-economic systems and AI/ML. The papers will be selected by the TPC based on their quality, novelty, utility and potential impact.
