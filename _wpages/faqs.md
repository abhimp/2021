##### Why Another AI/ML Conference? 

Through this annual conference, we are aiming to cover the whitespace at the intersection of data-intensive AI/ML techniques and systems engineering. We also aspire to become the leading forum for sharing practical experiences from building and deploying AI/ML systems in the socio-economic spheres such as public healthcare and security. 

Although being held in India, the conference aims to attract international participation and emphasize gender and geographic diversity.

This conference series is an initiative of the [COMSNETS Association](http://www.comsnets-association.org/), a not-for-profit organization, which has organized the prestigious [COMSNETS](https://comsnets.org) networking conference each year since 2009.
