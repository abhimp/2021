### Call for Papers

{:.text-justify.pe-4}
AIMLSystems is a brand new conference targeting research in the intersection of AI/ML
techniques and systems engineering. Through this conference we plan to bring out and highlight
the natural connections with these two fields. Specifically we explore how immense strides in
AI/ML techniques are made possible through computational systems research (e.g.,
improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, communications etc.), 
how the use of AI/ML can help in the continuous and workload-driven design space exploration
of computational systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimizers, learnable
network systems etc.) and, the use of AI/ML in the design of socio-economic systems such as
public healthcare, and security.  The goal is to bring together these diverse communities and
elicit connections between them.




#### Topics of Interest

The areas of interest are broadly categorized into the following three streams: 

1. Systems for AI/ML, including but not limited to:  
  * CPU/GPU architectures for AI/ML
  * Embedded hardware for AI/ML workloads
  * Data intensive systems for efficient and distributed training
  * Challenges in production deployment of ML systems
  * Efficient model training, optimization and inference
  * Hardware efficient ML methods
  * Resource-constrained ML
2. AI/ML for Systems, including but not limited to: 
  * AI/ML for VLSI and architecture design
  * AI/ML in compiler optimization 
  * AI/ML in data management - including database optimizations, virtualization, etc.
  * AI/ML for networks - design of networks, load modeling, etc.
  * AI/ML for power management - green computing, power models, etc.
3. Applications of AI/ML in Socio-Economic Systems Design, which includes, but not
limited to: 
  * Computational design and analysis of socio-economic systems
  * Fair and bias-free systems for social welfare, business platforms
  * Applications of AI/ML in the design, short-/long-term analysis of cyber-physical systems
  * Mechanism design for socio-economic systems
  * Applications of AI/ML in financial systems
