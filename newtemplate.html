                the size of application state that they wish to track across callbacks tothe library via API function R1.
                This function takes as argument thenumber of types of request objects and their sizes. Upon receivingthis
                information from the VNF, the library provisions multiple poolsof request objects per core, one pool for
                each object size, after round-ing up the request object sizes to the smallest power-of-2 block thatcan
                accommodate the object. Our implementation currently allows4 pools of220objects each per core, and the
                pools are preallocatedusing a slab allocator [22] to avoid dynamic memory allocation over-heads. The
                per-core request object pools are cache-optimized, andaccessed by the VNF threads in a lockfree manner.

                Every connection endpoint can be optionally associated with a re-quest object, and this object is returned
                on every callback associatedwith that endpoint. If a connection has no request object associatedwith it yet,
                API function R2 can be used to allocate a new requestobject of a specific size and associate it with a
                connection endpoint.Further, multiple connection endpoints (e.g., sockets to communi-cate withAandCatB)
                can also be associated with the same requestobject, because handling one application layer request can rely
                onmultiple asynchronous network communications. In such cases, APIfunction R3 can be used to associate an
                existing request object toanother connection endpoint. Once a VNF has completed processinga request (or has
                encountered an error and wishes to abort a request),the request object can be deallocated using API function
                R4. Notethat the API gives applications complete control over what state theywish to track across callbacks,
                and what the granularity of a requestis. We currently assume that the application has one outstanding re-quest
                at a time on a connection, and we plan to relax this assumptionin future work.Request objects can store
                pointers to other objects managed bythe library, e.g., packet buffers. Recall that API function C5 is usedto
                obtain a pointer to a non-evictable packet buffer, and such pointerscan be stored in request objects without
                worrying about the buffersbeing recycled. The VNF developer should take care to ensure thatthe pointers
                stored in a request object are released (e.g., packet buffermarked as evictable using function C6) before
                a request object isreleased. We assume that the memory allocated for a request objectis freed by the VNF
                developer at the end of the request processing.3.4  State ManagementThe libVNF API provides functions to
                store application state (as-sumed to be in the form of multiple tables of key-value pairs) acrossper-core
                threads of the VNF application, and across multiple dis-tributed replicas of a VNF. The API supports
                non-blocking get, set,and delete of these key-value pairs. Our framework provides a localdatastore that
                is shared across all threads of a single VNF instance,and a remote shared data store that is shared across
                multiple VNFreplicas. In addition, the library also maintains a local FIFO cacheof key-value pairs fetched
                from the remote datastore, which canbe used to improve performance when accessing remote state. Ourcurrent
                implementation assumes that keys are integers and valuesare dynamically allocated blobs of arbitrary size.

                API function D1 is used to store a key-value pair, in the local orremote datastores. The function is
                non-blocking, and an associatedcallback function is invoked when the set operation has completedby the
                library (successfully or otherwise). Function D2 is used to
