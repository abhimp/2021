  Gerhard Weikum:
    title: "Knowledge Graphs 2021: Achievements, Challenges and Opportunities"
    abstract: Machines with comprehensive knowledge of the world's entities and their relationships has been a long-standing vision and challenge of AI. Over the last two decades, huge knowledge bases, also known as knowledge graphs, have been automatically constructed from web data and text sources, and have become a key asset for search engines and other use cases. Machine knowledge can be harnessed to semantically interpret text in news, social media and web tables, contributing to  question answering, natural language processing and data analytics. This talk reviews these advances and discusses lessons learned (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/1900000064">http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/1900000064</a> for a comprehensive survey). Moreover, the talk identifies open challenges and new research opportunities.

    title: Machine Learning Modeling Best Practices
    abstract: I will talk about best practices when developing Machine Learning models such as generating uncertainty estimates for predictions, balancing exploitation with exploration, generating explanations for predictions, handling noise in training data, etc. I will show how we apply these modeling best practices at Amazon using real-world examples from our India e-commerce business.
